## PA-1 VIOLA
1. ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM: Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.
2. EMOTICON PROBLEM: Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad and mad with their corresponding emoticon:

variables. 
Example: 
Output: 
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 
first: 1 
middle: [2,3,4,5] 
last: 6

## PA 4 - VIOLA
Download the ECE Board Exam 2 dataset found on this link: [bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset](bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset) and write a Python script/code in the Jupyter Notebook to do the given problems. You may submit your Jupyter notebook in the dedicated submission bin.

### ECE BOARD EXAM PROBLEM:
Using data wrangling and data visualization techniques with storytelling, analyze the data and present different:
1. Data frames
2. Visuals using the dataset given

#### 1. Create the following data frames based on the format provided:
Example: `Vis = ["Name", "Gender", "Track", "Math<70"]`; hometown is constant as Visayas

**Output:**

| Name | Gender | Track         | Math |
|------|--------|---------------|------|
| S4   | Male   | Instrumentation | 65   |
| S11  | Female | Communication  | 48   |
| S22  | Female | Communication  | 64   |

**a. Filename:** `Instru = ["Name", "GEAS", "Electronics >70"]`; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown is Luzon

**b. Filename:** `Mindy = ["Name", "Track", "Electronics", "Average >=55"]`; where hometown is constant as Mindanao and gender is Female

#### 2. Create a visualization that shows how the different features contribute to the average grade. Does the chosen track in college, gender, or hometown contribute to a higher average score?
